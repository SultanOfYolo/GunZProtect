# GunZProtect
My old GunZ Protect Server/Client, including custom staff control panel and dll injector

This is created around 2007 - 2008. I release this because its total crap code, i used to code this as my first network program to update a game and protect it against hackers.
There is no skill at all, i just learned coding from google and crap, the code reflects that anyway.
